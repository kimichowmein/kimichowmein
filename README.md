# Howdy ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kimi, I build software (mostly web and mobile). My profile is a work in progress, I'm trying to
create a place to conviently store my configuration files to get up and ready as soon as possible, and
to change, iterate and improve over time. 

## What I'm using

[Starship](https://starship.rs/) - Shell customization

[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) - Text and code editing (WIP)

[Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) - Terminal multiplexer (WIP)

### Config files

Each config file should be self explanatory with comments within to help me when I come back to them,
so if someone other then me uses them, I hope their good enough.
